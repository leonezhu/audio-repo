But I still went on to summarize Li Xiaolai’s The Truth About Wealth.\n[由于昨晚难以入眠，导致今天大脑的状态不在“top shape”，但是依旧继续复述李笑来的《财富的真相》。]\nThe book opens with a bold claim: our fate is the result of our thinking.\n[首先，书中提出一个论点————命运都是思考的结果。]\nTo break it down: in the process of thinking, we use the concepts (attributes) we know as the basis for judgment, compare them according to our values, and then make decisions.\n[拆解开来就是：在思考的过程中，我们将自己知道的概念（属性）作为判断依据，通过自己的价值观比较得出结论做出决策；]\nThere are two key points about decision and action:\n[关于决策与行动这里有两点：]\nFirst, even after making a decision, we might not act on it—this is when values and behavior are in conflict.\n[第一点是决策完了也不一定行动，这就是价值观与行为冲突；]\nIn plain terms: we understand the reasoning, but our actions don’t match—this is what people often call “knowing but not doing.”\n[通俗地说就是道理都懂但是真实的行动与想象的不一致，也就是常说的知行不合一。]\nSecond, even if we take action, we might not get results—because outcomes depend on both luck and the quality of our actions.\n[第二点是行动了也不一定有结果，这里存在运气以及自己行动的质量；]\nStill, we must have the courage to act—because doing nothing guarantees a 0% chance of success.\n[即使如此，也需要有勇气做出行动，因为不行动就百分之一百没有可能性。]\nNow, onto wealth:\n[接下来关于财富的内容：]\nSmall money is called savings. Big money is called wealth.\n[小钱叫积蓄，大钱才叫财富；]\nThe only legitimate source of wealth is production.\n[财富的唯一正常来源只能是生产；]\nWe earn money by producing goods others need or providing services. When the amount of money we earn accumulates over time, it becomes wealth.\n[我们可以生产别人有需求商品、提供服务来赚钱，钱足够时间的积累变成大钱就叫财富。]\nProduction requires three types of resources: materials, demand, and time.\n[生产需要的三种生产资料分别是材料、需求、时间。]\nMaterials come from nature, demand comes from society, and both types of knowledge can be acquired through time.\n[材料来自自然、需求来自社会，这两类知识我们都可以通过时间来学习。]\nThat’s why time is the ultimate productive resource, and self-learning is the most essential skill.\n[所以说时间是终极生产资料，自学是最必须的技能。]\nSelling your time is the worst business model.\n[而出售自己的时间是最差的商业模式。]\nProduction takes three forms: discovery, creation, and transaction.\n[生产的形式包括发现、制作、与交易。]\nThe first two are more demanding, which is why the author especially values the skill of sales.\n[前两者对人的要求比较高，所以作者特别推崇销售这门技能。]\nMoney has two major uses: consumption and investment. Here are the author's original words on both:\n[钱有两大用处，消费与投资。关于这两点直接摘抄作者的原文：]\nSpending to satisfy desire is fun. The desire to invest needs to be cultivated slowly (with long-term thinking).\n[消费满足欲望很快乐。投资的欲望需要慢慢培养（长期主义）。]\nNow, it’s hard for you to spend recklessly—because you think money should be used to produce.\n[现在的你很难再乱花钱，因为你觉得应该用它生产;]\nIt’s hard for you to resent the rich—because you know they are creditors.\n[你很难再仇富，因为你知道有钱人是债权人;]\nIt’s hard for you to ignore personal finance—because you understand that money stores everything, including your freedom.\n[你很难再漠视理财，因为你知道钱是万物的存储，那里存着你的自由;]\nIt’s hard for you to be content with just selling your time—because you know that’s the worst personal business model.\n[你很难再安于直接出售你的时间，因为你知道那是最差的个人商业模式;]\nIt’s hard for you to blame the world—because you clearly understand that everything comes from how you spend your own time.\n[你很难再怨天尤人，因为你已经清楚地知道，其实，所有的一切都是从你自己的时间里挖出来的。]", "created_at": "2025-07-16T12:37:02.394291", "language_versions": {"en": {"audio_filename": "The_Truth_About_Weal..._en_20250716_123431.wav", "sentences": [{"text": "The Truth About Wealth", "start_time": 0, "end_time": 1.875, "language": "en"}, {"text": "\n", "start_time": 1.875, "end_time": 1.875, "language": "en"}, {"text": "财富的真相", "start_time": 1.875, "end_time": 1.875, "language": "zh"}, {"text": "\n", "start_time": 1.875, "end_time": 1.875, "language": "en"}, {"text": "Because I had trouble falling asleep last night, my brain wasn’t in “top shape” today.
